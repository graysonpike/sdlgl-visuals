# sdlgl-visuals
A project for testing artistic visualizations using my library, SDLGL.


Currently, I have implemented only one visualizaton, an isometric grid of cubes that move in "waves" defined by a Perlin noise function.

Building this project requires [SDLGL](https://github.com/graysonpike/sdlgl) to be installed. See the SDLGL README for installation instructions.


After installing SDLGL, you can build this project by running
